        </table>
        <p>A table or database in Excel  is a table consisting of rows and columns. These rows are
            often called <term>records</term> and the columns are called <term>fields</term>. The
            type of the collected data are in the columns. In the first row of a table you find
            column headers that indicate the kind of information in the column. The column headers
            are also called <term>field names</term>. The field names in the example are: custom
            nr., name, date, price and discount.</p>
        <p>To analyse data, it is important that the data is well-structured in the worksheet. A
            structured table has the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cells in each column contains the same type of data.</li>
            <li>The cells in each row contain the individual data of the object.</li>
            <li>The first row of the table contains the unique names of the fields. These names are
                usually formatted differently (larger font size, bold, italic, ... ) than the rest
                of the table.</li>
            <li>A table can start everywhere in the worksheet. It's not necessary that the first row
                of the table must be the first row of the worksheet.</li>
            <li>There should be no blank rows in the table. A row can contain empty cells, but not
                all cells can be empty.</li>
            <li>There should be no blank columns in the table. A column can contain empty cells, but
                not all cells can be empty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Excel, a table is a rectangular range of cells where data is stored. Although a table
            looks much like a regular Excel range, it offers a number of features that differentiate
            it from a range.</p>
        <p>A table can be created and maintained by just typing the data in the cells. In order to
            ensure a good structure, it is recommended to use a form for data entry. Itâ€™s not
            necessary that you first enter all your data before converting the range to a table.
            Once you have the table, you can always add new rows and columns. Large lists of data
            usually come from data from external files (text/csv files, webqueries, databases).</p>
        <p>In Excel 2016, you cannot create a table from scratch and then fill that table with data.
            Instead, you must first create a range that includes at least some of the data you want
            in your table and then convert that range to a table. When a range of data is
            transferred to a table, the appearance changes, but also built-in features are available
            for filtering, sorting and the ability to add a total row with several functions for
            totalization.</p>
