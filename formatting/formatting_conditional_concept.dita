        <p>The format of a cell can depend on certain conditions. For example, the background of the
            cell can be made red when the value in the cell is less than 6. This is called a
                <term>conditional format</term>. The formatting is applied if the condition(s) are
            met. If not, the <q>ordinary</q> format will be applied.</p>
        <p>To apply conditional formatting, you can use any combination of the following formatting
            options: number format, font, border, and background.</p>
        <p>In the condition test, the numerical value in the cell(s) will be compared with a
            different value. You can also compare the numerical value with a range of other values
            â€‹to determine whether there is a deviation from the average or, for example, belongs to
            the top three. There is no limit to the number of conditions.</p>
